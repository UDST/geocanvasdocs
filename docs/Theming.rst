Building footprint example


Scale factors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If things are too short, try a lower number.

If things are too tall, try a higher number.

Eg. If the attributes being visualized are very small, say around 0.001, and you want something that is .001 to be shown about 100 feet tall, 1 ft would have to equal *.00001*.

Going the other way, if the attributes being visualized are very large, say around 10,000,000, if you want the shape to be extruded to 100 ft, 1 ft would have to equal *100,000*.
