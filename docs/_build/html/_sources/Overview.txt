Overview
========

GeoCanvas is a fast, 3D, spatial data visualization tool.

In just a few steps, you can visualize attributes of anything that can be shown as shapes on a map, both in 2D and 3D. Built-in base map layers provide context and scale. You control what attributes are used to color your geographic data, and how to turn that same information into 3D visualizations. Once you've set up a visualization you like, you can capture it as an image in one click.
