Getting Started
===============

This section gives a high level overview of using GeoCanvas. The rest of the documentation fills in the details, and will be your main source of answers when you've got questions about how to do things, click by click. 

Using GeoCanvas is deceptively simple.
There are only four main steps:

1. Add shapes
2. Add attributes
3. Color shapes
4. Visualize in 3D
